#### This is my extra minimal neovim config that I use everyday.
It is **heavy** inspired (elegant way to avoid the word **copied**) by ThePrimeagen config, I just erase some of the complex stuff and plugins a noob like me won't even understand.
Also I mainly use **Java** beacuse that's what I'm learning in college (yes, I know), so if for whatever reason you decide to use this config, feel free to install the LSP of the language you use with :Mason command.

### TODOs
* Add coc-java
* Add lua-line or an alternative
* Some shortcuts for Java development
